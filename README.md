# Unity-Third-Person-Controller
This is a project for Third Person in Unity

To use the script Sam.cs, which is used to move the player. Use cinemachine for the camera by downloading it form the package manager. This will help to create smart type of camera
and the player should have Character Controller in it. The enemy and the projectile (bullet) should have Rigidbody in it and use NavMeshSurface and hit bake. (Download it
form my forked repo "NavMeshComponents")and NavMeshAgent in enemy and use Enemy.cs for your enemy.
